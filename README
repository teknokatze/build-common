Shared build-system files for (some) parts of Taler.

A repository using these build-system files should be structured as follows:

<my-repository.git>
- bootstrap (copied/adjusted from bootstrap.template)
- build-system (directory containing build system "stuff")
--| configure.py (copied/adjusted from bootstrap.template)
--| taler-build-scripts (git submodule of taler-build-scripts)
--| Makefile

Makefile and configure.py can also be placed directly into the root of the
repository.  However, this might lead to errors when "make" can be invoked
before bootstrap and configure has been done.
